### **Workshop Goal**
> This workshop is meant to familirize yourself with the basics of mapping in R. You do not need prior experience working with R, but having a general curiosity about computer science will help. You'll be asked a series of questions after each module (about 5 total) and to produce a few maps. An answer key is provided at the end. 

### **Learning Outcomes**
> By the end of this demo, you should be able to:
> 1. Define what R is and how it's applied to solve spatial problems
> 
> 2. Add GIS data formats like shapefiles
> 
> 3. Understand how to use basic functions and arguments 
> 
> 4. Ability to make a simple map in R like this one:
