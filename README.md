# Introduction to Mapping with R

This GitHub repository holds a template for a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages. You can find the public facing side of the template [here](https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io/gis-workshop-waml-template/).

The goal of this workshop is to teach you the basics of R and to create a map using the program.
