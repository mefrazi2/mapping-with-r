# Introduction to Mapping with R

This GitHub repository holds a template for a Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages. You can find the public facing side of the template [here](https://ubc-lib-geo.github.io/gis-workshop-waml-template/).

The goal of this workshop is to teach you the basics of R and to create a map using the program. 

The template provided here was orginally created by [Evan Thornberry](https://github.com/ect123) (UBC) and [Phil White](https://github.com/outpw) (CU Boulder) as part of the Western Association of Map Libraries (WAML) 2020 preconference workshop on teaching with GitHub.
