### **Arithmetic Options**

So, now that we have the terminology, let’s learn how to perform some arithmetic operations. R has operators that correspond to the basic arithmetic we learned in primary school: addition is +, subtraction is -, multiplication is * and division ia /. As you can see, R uses fairly standard symbols to denote each of the different operations you might want to perform: if I wanted to find out what 57 times 61 is (and who wouldn’t?), I can use R instead of a calculator, like so:

## 57 * 61

## [1] 3477

So that’s handy.

There are three other arithmetic operations that I should probably mention: taking powers, doing integer division, and calculating a modulus. Of the three, the only one that is of any real importance for the purposes of this book is taking powers, so I’ll discuss that one here: the other two are discussed later.
