### **R commands**

> One of the easiest things you can do with R is use it as a simple calculator, so it’s a good place to start. For instance, try typing 30, and hitting enter. When you do this, you’ve entered a command, and R will execute that command. What you see on screen now will be this:

> ## 10 + 20

> ## [1] 30

> Not a lot of surprises in this extract. But there’s a few things worth talking about, even with such a simple example. Firstly, it’s important that you understand how to read the extract. In this example, what I typed was the 10 + 20 part at the top, and the content below is what R produced.

> Secondly, it’s important to understand how the output is formatted. When you look at the output on your screen it will probably look like this [1] 30. Obviously, the correct answer to the sum 10 + 20 is 30, and not surprisingly R has printed that out as part of its response. But it’s also printed out this [1] part, which probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to you right now. For now you can think of [1] 30 as if R were saying “the answer to the first question you asked is 30”. That’s not quite the truth, but it’s close enough for now.
