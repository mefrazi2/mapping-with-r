> We typed the function `help` and then specified the argument (`package = cartography`). We could have easily just typed the function `help()`, without defining an argument.

> In the **Help** tab, we see information about the package `cartography` is pulled up, including all the functions within the package. This is super useful, and something you'll want to consult if you get stuck.

> If we click on the `barscale` function, it takes us here:

> We now see a display of all arguments associated with the function `barscale` and what they mean.
