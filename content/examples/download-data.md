### **Download Data**
> You can download the data from [here](/data/mapping_w_r_data.zip). Save it to a space that's easy for you (ex: I like to save my working files to my desktop). Then, **unzip** the file and open by double-clicking on the R markdown file (`workshop_script.R`). This will help you follow along the demo with step-by-step comments marked with `#`
