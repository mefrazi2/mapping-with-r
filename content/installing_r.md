[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

> ### **Installing RStudio**

> Go to the R studio website, and follow the links to download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). The version you want is the “RStudio Desktop”. Once the installer is downloaded, open it and follow the instructions.

> ### **RStudio Interface**
> 
> The **console** is where you can type commands and see output. 
> The **workspace** tab shows all the active objects. The **history** tab shows a list of commands used so far. 
> The **files** tab shows all the files and folders in your default workspace as if you were on a PC/Mac window. The **plots** tab will show all your graphs. The **packages** tab will list a series of packages or add-ons needed to run certain processes. If you're stuck, check out the **help** tab for more information.
