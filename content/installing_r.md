### **What is R?**
> 
> [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

### **Installing R**
>
> Go to the [R website](https://www.r-project.org/) and download the installer file. Once downloaded, open the installer file and follow the instructions.

### **Installing RStudio**
> 
> Go to the R studio website, and follow the links to download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). The version you want is the “RStudio Desktop”. Once the installer is downloaded, open it and follow the instructions.

### **RStudio Interface**
> 
> The **console** is where you will find the output of your coding and computations.
> 
> The **source window** can fulfil many functions, such astab shows all the active objects. The term ‘source’ can be understood as any type of file, e.g. data, programming code, notes, etc.
> 
> The **environment** tab shows you objects which are available for computation. The **history** tab stores your computatipns you in the consol. The **connections** tab allows you to tap into external databases directly. You can find additional materials to learn R and RStudio in the **tutorials** tab. 
> 
> The **files** lists all the files and folders in your root directory. The **plots** panel produces data visualizations, which will be important for today's tutorial. **Packages** are additional tools you can import and use when performing your analysis. A frequent analogy people use to explain packages is your phone and the apps you install. Each package you download is equivalent to an app on your phone. The **help**  panel allows you to search for specific topics, for example how certain computations work. It provides additional metadata that may be important in determining how a function or argument works.
